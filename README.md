A card game based on the popular 'Crazy 8s'.

## Rules

Players start with a countdown score of 8 and are dealt that number of cards at the beginning of the game.

Similar to Crazy 8s, cards are played according to suit matching or number matching in clockwise fashion. When a player gets rid of all the cards in their hand, their countdown score decreases and are dealt that number of cards.

Two is pick up 2, Queen of Spades is pick up 5, Jack is skip the next player's turn and King is reverse direction of play.

Wildcards correspond to your countdown score, this means '5's are your wildcard when your countdown score is 5.

The game ends once a player's countdown score reaches 0.

## How to setup
